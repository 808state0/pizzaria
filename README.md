Buonasera prepsters! 

You have been tasked with creating a website for *Pizzaria La DevLeague*, the hippest pizza joint where all the cool kids go.
Your job is to follow the instructions below and render a HTML layout in the `index.html` file. Run `live-server` in this project to see your work as you go through each step.

###The Setup

1. Fork and clone this project.
2. Open the `readme.md` file on one side of your text editor.
3. Open the `index.html` file on the other side of your text editor.
4. In the `index.html` file, create the basic HTML5 template layout (i.e. doctype, html lang, head and body tags, etc.).
5. In the head tag, insert the text "Best Pizza Ever" as the content for the title tag.

###The Layout
This site will have six sections:

1. Header
2. Today's Special
3. Menu
4. Subscribe
5. Visit
6. Footer
